Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 rows
ii. Business table = 10000 rows
iii. Category table = 10000 rows
iv. Checkin table = 10000 rows
v. elite_years table = 10000 rows
vi. friend table =  10000 rows
vii. hours table = 10000 rows
viii. photo table =  10000 rows
ix. review table = 10000 rows
x. tip table = 10000 rows 
xi. user table = 10000 rows
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 rows using primary key 'id'
ii. Hours = 1562 rows using foreign key 'business_id'
iii. Category = 2643 using foreign key 'business_id'
iv. Attribute = 1115 using foreign key 'business_id'
v. Review = 10000 rows using primary key 'id'
vi. Checkin = 493 rows using foreign key 'business_id'
vii. Photo = 10000 rows using promary key 'id'
viii. Tip = 537 rows usig foreign key 'user_id'
ix. User = 10000 rows using primary key 'id'
x. Friend = 11 rows using foreign key 'user_id'
xi. Elite_years = 2780 using foreign key 'user_id'

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:
	
	no

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
As we can see that, as the number of reviews decrease, total number of fans don't foloow the decrease fashion. So we can say that posting more reviews does not coorelate with more fans.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

I picked 'Las vegas' as city as it has the maximum reviews (Total review count: 82854) for all the business categories combined altogether.
In the category, I am chosing Restaurants as it's the most popular business category (Number of businesses in this category: 71)

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes, groups have different distribution of hours.
Group having 3-4 Stars open at 10:00 and close at 23:00 while
group having 2-3 Stars open at 11:00 and close at 0:00 throughout the week.
It seems like opeing earlier is a metric for getting good rating.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes, group having higher rating has more reviews.
Group having 4-5 Stars, haa review count of 768
Group having 2-3 stars has review count of 123.

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Nopes, no substantial information can be extracyed from the information of adress and neighborhood.

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
Open businneses have higher average review count
AVG (review_count) for open businesses: 445.5
AVG (review_count) for closed businesses: 168.8
         
ii. Difference 2:

 The average star rating is higher for businesses that are open than businesses that are closed.

			Open:   AVG(stars) = 4.0
			Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.5
